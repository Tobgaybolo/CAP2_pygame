# Chicken Egg Game

This is a simple Python game where a chicken lays eggs randomly and poops randomly. The player's task is to collect the eggs and avoid the poop. The game is built using the Pygame library and has been designed with test-driven development in mind, with unit tests provided for each function.

## Installation

To install the game, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system. You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

To run the game, navigate to the directory containing the game script and run the following command:

```bash
python game.py
```

## Game Rules

- The chicken lays an egg randomly on the screen.
- The chicken poops randomly on the screen.
- The player can move the basket left or right to collect the eggs.
- If the egg collides with the basket, the score increments.
- If the poop collides with the basket, the game ends.

## Testing

The game comes with a set of unit tests that verify the functionality of each function. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest test_game.py
```
